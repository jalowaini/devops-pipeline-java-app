🔄 Jenkins Pipeline Stages

Stage	Description
✅ Checkout	Pulls source code from GitHub
✅ Maven Build	Compiles project and generates .jar
✅ Docker Build	Builds Docker image from the .jar
✅ Push to ECR	Pushes the Docker image to Amazon ECR
✅ Deploy to EKS	Applies Kubernetes manifests (deployment/service)
✅ Post-deploy Test	Verifies that the app is running and reachable
✅ Results
CI/CD is fully automated via Jenkins

Docker Image stored in Amazon ECR

App is deployed to Amazon EKS with public access

Structure is production-ready and easily extensible

🔮 Future Enhancements
🔐 HTTPS via Ingress + Cert-Manager

📊 Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

🔄 GitOps with ArgoCD or Helm

🧪 Automated smoke testing post-deploy
